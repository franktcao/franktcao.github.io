# Welcome to My Blog! 

The `blog` is finally up and running!... but at the same time under heavy construction. I plan on posting about blogging (pretty meta, right?), tutorials on using the Raspberry Pi,
    cool data science projects, journaling my road to getting in shape, and sharing my experiences in this job hunt.

On the docket:
* **Getting started on a blog** using `github.io` and `jekyll` and adding features that this page doesn't have yet:
  * Adding tags to blogs 
  * Adding comments or a form to a blog
  * Adding a mailing list/subscription form
* **Raspberry Pi Tutorials**
  * Installing Pi-hole to block ads right from the router
  * Installing a firewall (ufw)
  * Installing Nextcloud to transform your extra external storage into cloud storage
* **Data Science Tutorials**
  * Computer Vision
    * Facebook's open source project DensePose
  * Web-scraping
    * Using `BeautifulSoup` to scrap indeed.com's job postings
  * SQL
    * Querying large datasets using Google's BigQuery variant 
* **Getting in Shape**
  * Where I am in life and what I'm doing about it
  * Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
* **Job Hunting**
  * Searching for the right fit
  * Finding exactly what I want to do

There's quite a bit of a list here. I hope you follow and see me get and keep it together!
