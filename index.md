<!-- # Welcome to My Blog!  -->

<p></p>
<!-- #### Updates:
{: style="color: red"}
* You can now subscribe to at-most biweekly updates (see top right in the navigation bar)!
* Each post will have tags associated to it so you can look up the tech & tutorial, health, or any other category.

The `blog` is finally up and running!... but at the same time under heavy construction. I plan on posting about blogging (pretty meta, right?), tutorials on using the Raspberry Pi,
    cool data science projects, journaling my road to getting in shape, and sharing my experiences in this job hunt. -->

<!-- On the docket:
* **Getting started on a blog** using `github.io` and `jekyll` and adding features that this page doesn't have yet:
  * ~~Adding tags to blogs~~ and/or creating different blog categories <font color='red'>✓</font> (08/31/19)
  * ~~Adding a mailing list/subscription form~~ <font color='red'>✓</font> (08/30/19)
  * Adding a form or functionality for comments/likes/upvotes to each blog as a means of receiving feedback 
* **Raspberry Pi Tutorials**
  * Installing `Pi-hole` to block ads right from the router
  * Installing a firewall (`ufw`)
  * Installing `Nextcloud` to transform your extra external storage into cloud storage
* **Data Science Tutorials**
  * Computer Vision
    * Cool and short `OpenCV` walk-throughs
    * Facebook's open source project `DensePose`
  * Web-scraping
    * Using `BeautifulSoup` to scrape indeed.com's job postings
    * Working with `Selenium` to navigate through a site
  * SQL
    * Querying large datasets using Google's `BigQuery` variant 
* **Getting in Shape**
  * Where I am in life and what I'm doing about it
  * Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
* **Job Hunting**
  * Searching for the right fit
  * Finding exactly what I want to do

There's quite a bit of a list here. I hope you follow and see me get and keep it together! -->
