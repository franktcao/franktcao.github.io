Frank is a recent physics PhD graduate from the University of Connecticut... Er -- I can't do this. 
It's me, Frank, writing this and it feels weird to write in third person when it's not a formal/scientific/academic setting. 

So, as I was saying... I recently got my PhD in physics and am looking to transition to a career in data science in my hometown of Boston.

I am using this site to document my journey \* *eye roll* \* in becoming a better person. The idea is to blog about cool projects I'm working 
(in data science, with the Raspberry Pi, this very blog, or anything I find cool enough to share), living a healthier lifestyle, and my progress 
in this job hunt.
