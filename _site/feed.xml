There is a large overlap between what is done in physics and what is done in data science. Unfortunately,

analysis of the vocabulary built out of what’s done here. We will be using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/code&gt; to parse the search results, loading them into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; dataframes and saving them to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; files to process in the next tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
